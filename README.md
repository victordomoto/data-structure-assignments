# Data structure assignments

Some applications of data structures used in the disciplines of algorithm and data structure I/II

### Brief description of each structure:

* **Stacks:** all the inserts, remotions and generally all accesses are carried out in a single far end, named top;


* **Queue:**  all removals and, in general, the accesses are performed in a end (front), and all inserts are made in another end (back); 


* **List:** a linear list is a data structure in which elements of a same type of data are logically organized in a way sequential:
  * **Linked list:** lists are unidirectional, that is, list follow starts from a point, the beginning, and goes to the end;
  
  * **Doubly circular linked list:** list has properties of both doubly linked list and circular linked list in which two consecutive elements are linked or connected by previous and next pointer and the last node points to first node by next pointer and also the first node points to last node by the previous pointer;


* **Graph:** a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes:
  * **Adjacency matrix :** a 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of vertices in a graph;
  * **Linear list  :** creates a simple topic map where each topic is associated to two other topics. First and last topics have exceptionally only one neighbor topic and one association;
  
  
* **Tree:**  A tree is a collection of nodes connected by directed (or undirected) edges. A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees;
